# HEBI MATLAB API Examples

This repository contains examples to go with the http://docs.hebi.us/tools.html#matlab-api[online documentation] that help to get started with the HEBI Robotics APIs for MATLAB. 


## Setup

All examples in this repository require the HEBI Robotics API for MATLAB in order to run. The API is included in this repository.  You can set it up using any of the `startup.m` scripts in the various example directories.


## Basic Examples

This folder contains examples that help you get started with the HEBI 
Robotics APIs for MATLAB.  There are separate examples for each of our 
different products.

* X-Series Actuator
* I/O Board
* Mobile I/O

The examples provided in each product work progressively through the following concepts:

* Lookup / Groups
* Feedback
* Commands
* Gains
* Trajectories
* Kinematics
* Example - Robot Arm

These API features and concepts are documented in more detail at:

* http://docs.hebi.us/tools.html#matlab-api
* http://docs.hebi.us/core_concepts.html


## Kits

This folder contains example code for various preconfigured kits. Additional documentation is available in the corresponding kit directories.
