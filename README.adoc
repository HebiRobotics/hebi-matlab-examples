# HEBI MATLAB API Examples

This repository contains examples to go with the http://docs.hebi.us[online documentation] that help to get started with the HEBI Robotics APIs for MATLAB. Note that the scripts use actuators that we used for testing, so you will need to change any naming to match your own actuators.

## Setup

All examples in this repository require the HEBI Robotics API for MATLAB in order to run. In order to use the bundled API, please run the `include.m` function in the include directory, or any of the `startup.m` scripts in the various example directories.

If you are setting up a new project you can download the latest API as follows

. download the latest API from the http://docs.hebi.us[documentation]
. unzip the file into a directory of your choice
. add the resulting _hebi_ folder to the MATLAB https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/path.html[path]
