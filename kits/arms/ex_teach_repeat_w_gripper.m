% Arm Teach-Repeat w/ Gripper Demo
%
% Features:      Demo with two modes.  One for moving the arm to different
%                waypoints while in a zero-force gravity-compensated mode.
%                And a second mode for playing back the waypoints.  In this
%                demo 'grip waypoints' can also be set that toggle a
%                gripper between being open and closed.
%
% Requirements:  MATLAB 2013b or higher
