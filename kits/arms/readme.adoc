# HEBI Robotics Kits - Arms

This folder contains examples for controlling arm-type configurations such as the 5-DoF and 6-DoF X-Series arm kits.

## Setup

### Load Libraries

These examples make use of a variety of HEBI libraries. In order to load the libraries correctly, please run `startup()` after starting up MATLAB.

### Setup Robot

In order to work with a robot arm, you need to establish communications, and create a matching kinematic model. If you are using a pre-configured link:http://docs.hebi.us/hardware.html#Kits[kit] with the default actuator types as well as default naming conventions, you can simply call `setupArm.m` in the example.

The `kit` variable needs to match your system. Currently the following kits are supported:

|====================

If you are using different actuator types or non-default configurations, you will need to modify the model to match your system. You can find tutorials on defining custom kinematic structures on the online link:http://docs.hebi.us/tools.html#kinematics[kinematics documentation]. The `setupArm.m` function should provide a good starting point.


## Examples

At the top of each file is a `setup` section that may expose options for testing different behaviors.

Examples that are dependent on the number of degrees of freedom follow a naming convention with the kit name suffixed. Examples that are applicable to all kits do not have a suffix. They default to using the `4dof` kit, so please modify accordingly.
