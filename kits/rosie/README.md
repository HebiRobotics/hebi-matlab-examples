# Rosie Demo Code

This folder contains everything needed to run the Rosie mobile manipulator kit.  It assumes that you have:
* Rosie Kit (Diff-drive, Omni-drive, or Mecanum-drive)
* iOS device capable of running ARKit (iPhone 6S or later, iPad 2017 or later, iPad Pro)

## To get started:
* Download this folder
* Start Matlab (2013b or later)
* run `startup.m`
* run `rosieDemo( 'mobileBaseType' )`
  - where `'mobileBaseType'` is: `'diff-drive'`, `'omni'`, or `'mecanum'`

The demo will start up looking for the actuators in the robot, followed by the mobile device for input.  

## Coordinate frame convention

* `X` = forward (from driver's perspective)
* `Y` = left (from driver's perspective)
* `Theta` = counter-clockwise rotation

## Input Controls

| Input      | Command   | Note  |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Right Joystick (`A8` and `A7`)  | Base X-Y Velocity |  |
| Left Joystick (`A1`) | Base Theta Velocity |  |
| Slider (`A6`) | Gipper force | Drag down to close. Drag up to open |
| Phone Pose | Arm end-effector pose |  |
| Slider (`A3`) | Scale of end-effector translation  | Should normally be all the way up. Drag this to all the way down, to reset the pose and hold it place. |
| Button (`B1`) | Reset Pose of the gripper| When you press this, make sure the phone is oriented face down, matching the gripper. |
