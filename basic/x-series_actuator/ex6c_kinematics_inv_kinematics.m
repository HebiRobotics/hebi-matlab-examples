% Inverse kinematics is where you specify a desired target pose for the 
% end-effector and calculate the joint angles that give you that pose.  
startXYZ = [ 0.5; -0.2; 0.1 ];  % [m]
endXYZ = [ 0.5; 0.2; 0.1 ];   % [m]

% Because the API uses local optimization to calculate IK, you need to give 
% an initial guess for the joint angles.  The guess should be something
% that looks similar to what you want the arm to look like, capturing
% things like "elbow-up" vs "elbow-down" configurations.  Generally, do not
% provide initial conditions that are near kinematic singularities, or 
% where all or most of the joint angles are 0.
initPositions = [-pi/4 pi/4 pi/2];  % "elbow up" solutions

% Calculate forward kinematics gradualy from the start position to the end
% postion and display.  THIS INTERPOLATION WILL BE A STRAIGHT LINE IN
% WORKSPACE.
