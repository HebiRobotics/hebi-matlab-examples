# HEBI MATLAB API - Basic Examples

This folder contains examples that help you get started with the HEBI 
Robotics APIs for MATLAB.  There are separate examples for each of our 
different products:
  - X-Series Actuator
  - I/O Board
  - Mobile I/O

The examples provided here work progressively through the following concepts:
* Lookup / Groups
* Feedback
* Commands
* Gains
* Trajectories
* Kinematics
* Example - Robot Arm

These API features and concepts are documented in more detail at:
* http://docs.hebi.us/tools.html#matlab-api
* http://docs.hebi.us/core_concepts.html


# Setup

To begin, run the 'startup.m' script.

This will add the various folder paths and libraries to the MATLAB search 
path so that the API works correctly.
